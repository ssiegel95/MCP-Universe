The query that used to run in milliseconds is now taking over a second to complete, causing timeout issues in their reporting dashboard.\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze and optimize the performance of this customer analytics query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    c.customer_id,\n    c.first_name,\n    c.last_name,\n    c.email,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT p.payment_id) as total_payments,\n    SUM(p.amount) as total_spent,\n    AVG(p.amount) as avg_payment,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT EXTRACT(month FROM p.payment_date)) as active_months,\n    MAX(p.payment_date) as last_payment,\n    MIN(p.payment_date) as first_payment,\n    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment p2 WHERE p2.customer_id = c.customer_id AND p2.amount > 5.0) as high_value_payments,\n    (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM payment p3 WHERE p3.customer_id = c.customer_id AND p3.payment_date >= '2007-03-01') as recent_spending\nFROM customer c\nJOIN payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id\nWHERE c.active = 1\nGROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email\nHAVING COUNT(p.payment_id) >= 10\nORDER BY total_spent DESC, total_payments DESC;\n```",
