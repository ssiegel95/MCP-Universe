    "question": "Create a comprehensive employee performance evaluation system that analyzes career progression patterns and salary equity across our organization. The executive team needs data-driven insights for upcoming promotion decisions and salary adjustment planning.\n\n## Your Tasks:\n\n1. **Create the employee performance analysis table** — build a table called `employee_performance_analysis` in the `employees` schema with these exact columns:\n   * `employee_id` (bigint) — the employee's ID\n   * `performance_category` (varchar) — classification of employee performance ('high_achiever', 'steady_performer', 'needs_attention')\n   * `salary_growth_rate` (decimal) — percentage salary increase from first salary record to current\n   * `days_of_service` (integer) — total days with the company\n   * `promotion_count` (integer) — number of different titles held\n\n2. **Analyze only current employees** — focus on employees who currently have active salary records (to_date = '9999-01-01').\n\n3. **Apply performance classification rules**:\n   * **High achievers**: Salary growth rate > 40% AND more than 1 title held\n   * **Needs attention**: Salary growth rate < 15% AND more than 3650 days of service (10 years)\n   * **Steady performers**: All other current employees (default category)\n\n4. **Create the department salary analysis table** — build a table called `department_salary_analysis` in the `employees` schema with:\n   * `department_name` (varchar) — the department name\n   * `avg_current_salary` (decimal) — average current salary in the department (only current employees)\n   * `employee_count` (integer) — total current employees in the department\n   * `salary_range_spread` (integer) — difference between max and min salary (current employees only)\n\n5. **Calculate salary equity metrics** — populate the department table with current salary statistics for active employees only to identify potential pay equity issues across departments.",
