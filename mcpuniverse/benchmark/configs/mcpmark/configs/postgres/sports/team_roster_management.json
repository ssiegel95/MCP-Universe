Set Up Player Performance Tracking\nCreate a table called `player_evaluation` with the following structure:\n- performance_id (serial primary key)\n- person_id (integer not null, references persons(id))\n- batting_avg (decimal)\n- home_runs (integer)\n- rbis (integer)\n- games_played (integer)\n- performance_score (decimal)\n- evaluation_date (date)\n\nAdd constraint: CHECK (batting_avg BETWEEN 0 AND 1)\n\n### 2. Load Historical Player Statistics\nInsert player performance data into `player_evaluation`:\n- Select all players who have offensive statistics\n- Calculate batting average as hits/at_bats\n- Calculate performance score as (batting_avg * 100) + home_runs + rbis\n- Use current date as evaluation_date",
