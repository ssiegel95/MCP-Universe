    "question": "Your goal is to create a new study-session entry in the **Computer Science Student Dashboard** page.\n\n1. Locate the ☑️ Habit tracker section of the page.\n2. **Insert a new date section** immediately **after the existing `2022-09-02` to-do items but *before* the divider block** that follows them. Make sure the new date has proper formatting with a date mention and bold styling like the existing dates, and all to-do items should be unchecked initially. The new section should be inserted right after the 2022-09-02 to-do items but before the divider.\n3. Directly **beneath** this new date mention, add **exactly four unchecked to-do blocks** with the following plain text (including the leading emoji on each line):\n   • 🧠 Review algorithms for technical interview\n   • 📚 Study database systems chapter 7\n   • ⚡ Practice system design problems\n   • 🎯 Complete data structures assignment",
