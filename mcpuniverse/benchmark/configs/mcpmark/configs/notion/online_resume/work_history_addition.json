    "question": "Hi! I realized I forgot to include one work experience on my resume page titled \"Online Resume.\" Could you please help me add it to the \"Work History\" section?\n\nThe position is \"Research Assistant,\" and it took place from January to August 2023. The description should be: \"Assisted in conducting user experience research projects at my bachelor's program, supporting data collection, analyzing user feedback, and preparing research reports. Developed strong skills in research methodologies and improved collaboration with interdisciplinary teams.\"\n\nFor the image or logo, please use the one from the \"Education\" section (my bachelor school) to keep everything consistent.\n\nAlso, please make sure that the formatting — including font style, size, and layout — matches the existing entries in the Work History section so it looks seamless.\n\nThank you!",
