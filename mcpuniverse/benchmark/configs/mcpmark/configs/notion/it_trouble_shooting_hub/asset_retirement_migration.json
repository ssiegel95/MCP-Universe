    "question": "Please restructure the **IT Inventory** database as described below. Your automation will be checked by an automated script, so follow every detail exactly.\n\n---\nTask Steps\n1. Inside the **IT Trouble Shooting Hub** page, locate the database named **IT Inventory**.\n2. Query this database and collect every page whose **Status** property is **Expired** or **To be returned**.\n3. Create a **new full-page database** directly under the same IT Trouble Shooting Hub page called **IT Asset Retirement Queue**.\n4. Configure this new database so that it contains **exactly** the following properties (spellings and types must match):\n   • Serial – title  \n   • Tags – multi_select  \n   • Status – select  \n   • Vendor – select  \n   • Expiration date – date  \n   • Retirement Reason – select with option set { **Expired License**, **Hardware Obsolete**, **Security Risk**, **User Offboarding** }\n5. For every inventory item gathered in step2:\n   a. Create a corresponding page in **IT Asset Retirement Queue** and copy over the values of the Serial, Tags, Status, Vendor and Expiration date properties.  \n   b. Set **Retirement Reason** to one of the four options above (choose the most appropriate).  \n   c. Archive the original inventory page **after** the new page has been created.\n6. After all items are migrated:\n   a. Update the **description** of the **IT Asset Retirement Queue** database so it is **exactly** `AUTO-GENERATED MIGRATION COMPLETED` (no additional text).\n   b. Create a new page under **IT Trouble Shooting Hub** titled **Retirement Migration Log**. Inside this page, add a **callout block** whose text follows the exact pattern:\n\n      `Successfully migrated <N> assets to the retirement queue on 2025-03-24.`\n\n      • `<N>` is the total number of items moved.",
