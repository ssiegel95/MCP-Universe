(exclude expenses in project/work)\n3. **Create a file named `total_budget.txt`** in the main directory\n4. **Format each expense entry** as `file_path;price` (one per line)\n5. **Add total sum** as the last line, rounded to 2 decimal places\n\n### Output Format\n\nThe `total_budget.txt` file should contain:\n\n- One expense per line in format: `file_path;price`\n- File path should be the relative path from the main directory\n- Price should be rounded to 2 decimal places\n- Last line should be the total sum\n- No additional text or explanations\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Only include personal life expenses (not in project/work)\n- Use the cheapest available price when multiple options exist for one thing\n- The total should match the sum of all individual expenses\n- Hint: If a file contains 1 item for personal consumption, it means that all the entry in entire file is for personal consumption",
