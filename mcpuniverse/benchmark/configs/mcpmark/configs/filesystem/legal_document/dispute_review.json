The comment format is `[name:content]`, where:\n- `name` is the commenter's name\n- `content` is the revision note\n\n**Special Note:** If the name is \"All parties\", it represents a joint comment from all parties, which counts as one comment but does not count toward any individual's personal comment count.\n\n## Task\n\nYour task is to review these versions and identify all clauses that have been commented in **v5,6,7 (in folder legal_files/)**. Generate a file named `dispute_review.txt` in the main directory. In this file, list each commented clause on a separate line and indicate the number of comments for each clause in the format \"Clause number:number of comments\". Clause number should be in the format of X.X.",
