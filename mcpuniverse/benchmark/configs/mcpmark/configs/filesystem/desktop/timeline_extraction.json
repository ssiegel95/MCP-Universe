Write the timeline in the file in the following format.\n\n### Rules\n- If a task only shows month without day, use the 1st day of that month\n- If a task only shows year without month and day, skip it.\n- If a file shows multiple tasks on the same date, count only once per date\n\n### Output Format\n- Each line format: `file_path:time`\n    - `file_path`: The file path where this time information appears (**relative to the current path**)\n    - `time`: Specific time, if it's a time period, write the start time (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n### Sorting Requirements\n- Sort by chronological order",
