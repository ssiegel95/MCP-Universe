Your task is to create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary Python dependencies for running this codebase.\n\n### Task Objectives\n\n1. **Create a requirements.txt file** in the main directory\n2. **Include all essential dependencies** needed to run the VoteNet codebase\n3. **Ensure the file format is correct** (one dependency per line)\n4. **Save the file as `requirements.txt`** in the current working directory\n5. **Not just** pip install or conda install, your answer should contain **every necessary dependencies in the whole process of VoteNet**.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe requirements.txt file should contain Python packages that are necessary for:\n- 3D point cloud processing\n- Deep learning frameworks\n- Computer vision libraries\n- Data visualization\n- 3D mesh processing\n- Network/graph operations\n\n### Note\n\n- You can examine the codebase structure and README to understand what packages are needed\n- The file should be saved as `requirements.txt` in the current directory\n- Each dependency should be on a separate line\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nThe requirements.txt file should contain at least these dependencies:\n- matplotlib\n- opencv\n- plyfile\n- trimesh\n- pointnet2\n- networkx\n\nAnd should have:\n- At least 3 dependencies\n- No duplicate entries\n- Proper file format",
