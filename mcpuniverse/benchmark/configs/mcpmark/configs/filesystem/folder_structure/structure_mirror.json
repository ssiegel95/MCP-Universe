Do not use python code.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Create the entire directory structure in `complex_structure_mirror/`\n- Do not copy any file contents, only create directories\n- In each empty directory, create a `placeholder.txt` file containing the absolute path of that directory\n- Handle nested directories of any depth\n- You should also follow 2 rules:\n  1. **Discard any directory that directly contains more than 2 files (only count the immediate folder).**\n  2. **If a directory name contains numbers, append \"_processed\" to the mirror directory name**\n\n### Expected Output\n\nAfter completing the task:\n- `complex_structure_mirror/` directory exists\n- All directories from `complex_structure/` are mirrored with modified names (if they contain numbers)\n- Directories with more than 2 files are excluded\n- Each empty directory contains a `placeholder.txt` file with the absolute path\n- No file contents from the source directory are copied",
