Your task is to explore the codebase and identify the specific file that defines the guidance functionality for the Zero123 model.\n\n### Task\n\nWhat is the output of `guidance_out`, returned by the code at line 137 in `threestudio/systems/zero123.py`?\n\nClearly state the structure of it and where you find the answer (file and line numbers). Write your answer in a file named `answer.txt` in the test directory root. Do not add extra explanation or formatting beyond what is required by the task.\n\n### Expected Output\n\nCreate a file named `answer.txt` containing:\n- The four required output fields: loss_sds, grad_norm, min_step, max_step\n- Line numbers where these fields are defined (lines 323-324 and 327-328)\n- The file path: threestudio/models/guidance/zero123_guidance.py\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nThe answer file should contain:\n- All four strings: \"loss_sds\", \"grad_norm\", \"min_step\", \"max_step\"\n- Line number 323 or 324\n- Line number 327 or 328\n- The file path \"threestudio/models/guidance/zero123_guidance.py\"",
