Your task is to explore the codebase and identify the specific file that defines the guidance functionality for the Zero123 model.\n\n### Task Objectives\n\n1. **Explore the ThreeStudio codebase** using filesystem MCP tools\n2. **Search through the project structure** to understand the codebase organization\n3. **Identify the file** that contains the Zero123 guidance implementation\n4. **Create an answer file** with the correct file path\n\n### Expected Output\n\nCreate a file named `answer.txt` in the test directory root\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Only include the file path, no additional text or explanation\n- Use forward slashes (/) for path separators\n- Include the full relative path from the project root\n- Ensure the path points to the actual file that defines Zero123 guidance\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nThe answer file should contain the path to `zero123_guidance.py` which:\n- Contains the class `Zero123Guidance`\n- Has the decorator `@threestudio.register(\"zero123-guidance\")`\n- Is located in the models/guidance directory",
