Create three subdirectories and move files accordingly.\n\n### Task Objectives\n\n1. **Create three directories** in the test directory:\n   - `small_files/` - for files smaller than 300 bytes\n   - `medium_files/` - for files between 300-700 bytes (inclusive)\n   - `large_files/` - for files larger than 700 bytes\n\n2. **Move all files** from the test directory into the appropriate subdirectory based on their size\n\n3. **Handle all file types** - classify all files regardless of their extension (.txt, .jpg, .MOV, etc.)\n\n### Expected Output\n\nAfter completing the task, the directory structure should be:\n- `small_files/` containing files < 300 bytes\n- `medium_files/` containing files 300-700 bytes\n- `large_files/` containing files > 700 bytes\n- No files remain in the root test directory",
