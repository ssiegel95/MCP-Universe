    "question": "I need you to perform a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Model discussions on this forum platform and create a summary post. This analysis will help me understand the community's engagement with LLM topics.\n\n\n**Important:** The forum is accessible at http://localhost:9999\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n\n1. Register a new account with username 'llm_analyst_2024' and password 'LLMExpert2024!'\n\n2. After successful registration, navigate to the MachineLearning forum at http://localhost:9999 and analyze posts about Large Language Models:\n   - Count all posts on the first page that contain 'GPT', 'ChatGPT', or 'LLM' in their titles\n\n3. Identify the top 3 posts with the highest upvote counts from your LLM-related posts list and record their complete details\n\n4. Navigate to the deeplearning forum at http://localhost:9999 and go to page 2:\n   - Find the post with the most comments on page 2\n   - Record its exact title and comment count\n\n5. Create a new submission in the MachineLearning forum with:\n   - Title: \"LLM Research Summary: GPT Discussions Analysis [2024]\"\n   - Body text must be EXACTLY these lines without anything (keep the keys as-is, only replace the values after the pipe, follow the markdown format):\n\n```\n- Total_LLM_Posts|FILL_VALUE\n- Top1_Title|FILL_VALUE\n- Top1_Upvotes|FILL_VALUE\n- Top1_Date|FILL_VALUE\n- Top2_Title|FILL_VALUE\n- Top2_Upvotes|FILL_VALUE\n- Top2_Date|FILL_VALUE\n- Top3_Title|FILL_VALUE\n- Top3_Upvotes|FILL_VALUE\n- Top3_Date|FILL_VALUE\n- Deeplearning_MostDiscussed|FILL_VALUE\n- Deeplearning_Comments|FILL_VALUE\n```",
